Using Temperature to Model Water Levels in the Great Salt Lake from 1990 to 2022
- Two Locations: Saltair Boat Harbor and GSL near Saline, UT
- Data found at USGS and National Weather Service
- Predicts temperature over time
- Predicts water level over time
- Graphs water level vs temperature
- Correlation coefficient for water level vs. temperature is around -0.5, meaning there is a negative, moderately strong relationship
Summary of Findings:
- On average, temperature in Salt Lake City is increasing by 0.1032Â°C every year
- On average, the water level in the Great Salt Lake at the Saltair Boat Harbor is decreasing by 0.3092 feet per year
- On average, the water level in the Great Salt Lake at Saline, UT is decreasing by 0.2974 feet per year
- For both locations, there was a correlation coefficient of around -0.5 for water level vs temperature, meaning that there was a moderately strong, negative correlation between temperature and water level. 
- On average, as temperature increases by 1 C, water level decreases by 0.9 feet
